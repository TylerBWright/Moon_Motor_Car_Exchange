<h2>Moon Motor Car Exchange Project</h2>

<p>This is an online vehicle marketplace dealing exclusively in antique Moon Motor Cars.  This project was written in Java, HTML, and CSS in a Spring MVC framework as partial fulfillment of requirements for Claim Academy’s Java Full Stack Developer curriculum.

Members are prompted to register or log-in in order to participate fully in the Moon Motor Car Exchange.  Members have the following options:

<ol>
<li>Browse current listings.</li>
<li>Filter the display of current listings by car model.</li>
<li>Purchase a Moon Motor Car.</li>
<li>List their own Moon Motor Car for sale.</li>
<li>Connect with other members.</li>
<li>Edit their profile.</li>
<li>Check the status of their pending transactions.</li>
<li>Cancel transactions, which are then relisted on the exchange.</li>
<li>Review a log of transactions.</li>
</ol>

The administrator has additional options beyond that of a member and provides complete oversight over the exchange.  The administrator (<strong>username:</strong> admin@mooncarexchange.com, <strong>password:</strong> password) shares the same functions as members, in addition to the following:

<ol>
<li>Remove users.</li>
<li>Review a complete list of pending transactions.</li>
<li>Close out transactions between buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>Review a complete log of all finalized Moon Motor Car Exchange transactions.</li>
</ol>

The Moon Motor Car Exchange is preloaded with a total of 9 members with unique emails and passwords and 1 administrator.  In order to explore all that this application offers, it is recommended to log into a several accounts to conduct transactions and see how it all works together.  Log in as Percy Benjamin to perform administrative functions.  One also has the option to register a new dummy account.  Login credentials for each of the preloaded accounts may be found in the <em>UserService.java</em> file.

Feel free to take a look under the hood and let me know if you have any questions or recommendations to improve on this project.

Many thanks goes out to:

<ol>
<li>Brad Hussey (https://www.bradhussey.ca/) and his Udemy course <em>“Build Websites from Scratch with HTML & CSS,”</em> which helped me out immensely in building out the front-end of this project.</li>
<li>Lamar Myles, instructor with Claim Academy, and student mentor Brandon Owens.  They helped me work through Spring MVC territory with which I was unfamiliar and they continue to provide world-class support.</li>
<li>Moon Car Club (https://mooncarclub.com/) for providing wonderful vintage stock photos and information on this unique period of automobile history.  I probably got a few things wrong, but I attempted to remain as faithful as possible to the real world (e.g.: assigning value to preloaded cars).</li>
